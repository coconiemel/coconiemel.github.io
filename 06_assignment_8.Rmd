# R packages (8) {-}

## Introduction {-}

In this assignment I created a R package to support my portfolio, following [The Whole Game demo](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html) made by Hadley Wickham. The demo guided me through setting up my own package and helped me create something useful on my own after.

## Copopa {-}

To start a new package, a name is necessary. I combined my name, "portfolio" and "package" together into a fun word an checked availability with the "available" package. 

The name was available, so I set up the project and the github repository to get started.

A package to support my portfolio would reduce duplicated code. But scanning through my portfolio, I noticed that there wasn't a lot of code or duplicated code. Luckily, i found some in the "Relational data and databases" assignment that would work for this. The package that i made contains two functions:
<ul><li>check_type() -> checks the data type of datasets, or columns in it.</li>
<li>save_to_csv_rds() -> saves a dataframe into CSV and RDS files.</li></ul>
For the manual and contents of the package, please visit [the copopa github repository](https://github.com/coconiemel/copopa).
